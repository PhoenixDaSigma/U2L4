1. The dimensions need to be the same.

2. The columns of the first matrix need to be equal to the rows of the second matrix.

3. The resulting matrix has the dimensions of the first matrix's rows and the second's columns, so the dimensions can be figured out before the matrix is even calculated.

4. In matrix multiplication, the outer loop must go through A[n] iterations, and the inner loop goes through B[m] iterations.

5. The len() function that gives us the dimensions in integer form
